There is a two types of user groups-
1)Doctor
2)Patient
Both of the groups have different permissions. (Think about this )
● Authenticate the user and get the data related to the user's role

● a) If an authenticated user has the role as a doctor then he can have information about
patient files and he/she can view their own information.
● b) If an authenticated user has the role of the patient then he can only see his medicine data and he/she can view their own information.
